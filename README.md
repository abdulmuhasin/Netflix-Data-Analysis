# Netflix-Data-Analysis
<B>Netflix Data:Cleaning, Analysis,and Visualization</B><br>
This project involves loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data from a Netflix  dataset. We'll use Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to work  through the project. The goal is to explore the dataset, derive insights.
In this project, we:<br>
1. Cleaned the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types.<br>
2. Explored the data through various visualizations such as bar plots and word clouds.<br>
3. Analyzed content trends over time, identified popular genres, and highlighted top directors.<br>
Next Steps<br>
1. Feature Engineering: Create new features, such as counting the number of genres per movie or extracting the duration in minutes.<br>
2. Machine Learning: Use the cleaned and processed data to build models for recommendations or trend predictions.<br>
3. Advanced Visualization: Use interactive plots or dashboards for more detailed analysis.<br>
This project is a foundational exercise that introduces essential data analysis techniques, paving the way for more advanced projects.
